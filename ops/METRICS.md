# Metrics

Every metric here must name its source. Never invent, extrapolate, or manually inflate a number. If a metric cannot be sourced yet, it stays listed as UNMEASURED.

## Definitions

- **Applications submitted** — rows in the D1 applications table (source: `wrangler d1 execute attention_feed --remote`). UNMEASURED as of 2026-08-06.
- **Members activated** — members with ≥1 session after approval (source: D1 sessions). UNMEASURED.
- **Attention events** — stars/skips/opens recorded (source: D1). UNMEASURED.
- **Human traffic** — Cloudflare `/cdn-cgi/rum` or Worker-side instrumentation only. Raw CF request counts are scanner-dominated and must never be cited as human traffic.
- **Gross cash collected** — payment provider records only. Currently **$0 and unmeasurable: no billing exists**. No other source may ever back this number.

## Measurement audit — 2026-08-06 (run 1)

Funnel stage by stage, with whether a source exists **and** whether the executor can read it.

| Stage | Recorded in | Executor can read? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landing view | **nothing** — no view instrumentation exists | n/a |
| Application / waitlist | `waitlist` table | no — no CF credentials |
| Approval → member | `members` row | no |
| Member login | **nothing** — no login/session event log | n/a |
| Feed creation | `creators` row | no |
| First find | `items` row | no |
| Star / skip | `reads` table (`action`, `created_at`) | no |
| Return visit | `members.last_desk_at` — **single overwritten timestamp** | no |
| Payment | **does not exist** | n/a |

Four gaps, ordered by how much they block learning:

1. **Return/retention is structurally unmeasurable.** `last_desk_at` is overwritten on each visit, so D1/D7 return and repeat-use — the core retention evidence the decision hierarchy asks for — can never be computed from the current schema, even with database access. Fixing this needs an additive visit-event table, not a query.
2. **Landing → application conversion is unmeasurable.** No view instrumentation. Cloudflare request counts are scanner-dominated and must never be substituted (see Human traffic above).
3. **No executor read path to D1.** `wrangler whoami` reports unauthenticated in the routine session, by design — the Git-based pipeline exists so the executor never holds Cloudflare credentials. Consequence: every table-sourced metric below stays UNMEASURED until the owner supplies a read path or pastes query output into issue #1.
4. **No payment path**, so gross cash stays $0 and unmeasurable.

## Snapshots

_Append dated snapshots below; each line cites its source query._

### 2026-08-06 (run 1)

- Applications submitted — UNMEASURED (no executor read path to D1).
- Members activated — UNMEASURED (same).
- Attention events — UNMEASURED (same).
- Human traffic — UNMEASURED (no instrumentation exists).
- Gross cash collected — **$0**, source: no billing exists. Not an estimate.
- Production reachability from the routine session — **blocked**: `justtuned.com:443` returns 403 at the egress proxy (CONNECT policy denial), so post-deploy verification cannot be performed from here. Recorded, not worked around.
