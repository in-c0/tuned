# Decisions log

Append-only record of consequential decisions and reversals.

## 2026-08-06 — 60-day autonomous loop started

- Owner committed Tuned as one bounded autonomous commercial bet through **2026-10-05** (Sydney). Claude = executor/developer/QA/operator (Claude Code Routine on `in-c0/tuned`, runs 08:00/14:00/20:00 Sydney). ChatGPT = reviewer (~07:30/13:30/19:30 Sydney, one directive per review into issue #1).
- Adopted the owner's 2026-08-06 repositioning brief (ops/BRIEF-2026-08-06.md) as the working commercial hypothesis: single-player "attention inbox for your agents" wedge first; lead with "Wake up to the few things worth your attention."
- Deployment pipeline decision: Cloudflare Workers Builds Git integration on branch `master` (build `npm ci && npm run check`, deploy `npx wrangler deploy`), so the executor never holds Cloudflare credentials. Pending owner connecting it in the dashboard (auth boundary).
- Autonomous spend cap: **AUD $0** until the owner states otherwise.
- Known structural gap acknowledged at start: no billing exists, so revenue is impossible until a payment path ships; payment-provider account creation is an owner step.
